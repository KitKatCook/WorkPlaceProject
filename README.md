# WorkPlaceProject

Assessment Details
The project is assessed by a project report and a presentation. The report contributes 70% to the module grade, and the presentation contributes 30%. Further guidance is given in the assessment brief sections.

The project will be graded using the standard university grading system, and will contribute to your overall classification. Your degree classification will be mapped to the table below to give your apprenticeship grade (Please note: this table is taken directly from the apprenticeship standard which is why there is a table for marks).

Degree Award Class				Grading Equivalence 	Marks Level
First-class Honours (1st) 			Distinction 			70+
Second-class Honours, upper division (2:1) 	Merit					60–69
Second-class Honours, lower division (2:2) 	Pass					50–59 
Third-class Honours (3rd)			Pass					40–49 

The work will be marked by your project supervisor, the independent assessor and someone from your workplace (eg line manager, apprenticeship mentor). They will mark the work and agree the final grade. All projects will then be moderated by other members of the course team to ensure consistency.

 You are required to write a report documenting the work undertaken for your work-based project. Your report should cover:

Introduction
	Overview of the Report
	Structure of the Report
Background work undertaken eg 
	Analysis of the problem, including current system
	Background work and research, including analysis of possible solutions
	Potential issues arising (LSEP)
Project Definition
	Aims and Objectives
	Requirements, including requirements analysis and scope
	Planning
	Success Criteria
Design
	Design artifacts
J	ustification
Implementation
	Explanation of the process
	Challenges faced and solutions
Results
	Final outputs
	Testing 
	Evaluation of success, measured against success criteria
Conclusions
	Evaluation of the project, including planning and how LSEP issues have been addressed
	Future direction

You are required to provide a KSB map as an appendix, which shows where your project demonstrates the KSBs. Further appendices can be used to supplement the main report, eg full design documentation.

The main body of your report should be 10,000-20,000 words, which is approx 40-60 pages, using double line spacing. Further guidance on the formatting of the report will be given.

The report will be marked against the following module learning outcomes:

K1 Synthesise and apply advanced knowledge in chosen area of study
K2 Conduct an investigation into a problem in computing and/or technology and use appropriate analysis, design, implementation and evaluation techniques to investigate solutions to the problem, using existing sources of information as appropriate 
K3 Demonstrate an understanding of the professional, ethical, legal and social issues relevant to computing/technology developments
K4 Demonstrate the knowledge required for the degree apprenticeship standard
S1 Formulate and execute a plan of activities to achieve realistic objectives
S2 Critically review your own work
S3 Present a substantive written account of a computing project in a logical and coherent manner
S5 Take responsibility for your own learning, demonstrating self-direction, resilience, and maturity and originality in negotiating the project, planning and implementing tasks in a professional manner
S6 Demonstrate the skills and behaviour required for the degree apprenticeship standard

After submitting the report, you are required to give a presentation to your project supervisor, independent assessor and workplace supervisor. The presentation will take in the week following the submission of the report

The presentation should focus on the outcomes of the project - what you have done, how you did it and the standard of your work - and will include a demonstration of the work. The presentation and Q&A session will typically last 30mins. A structured brief for the session will be provided, to ensure consistency. You will need to respond to questions about your project and achievement of the apprenticeship KSBs.

The exact date, time and location of the presentation will be determined nearer the time, and you will be given at least 7 days notice.

The presentation will be assessed against the following module learning outcomes:

K1 Synthesise and apply advanced knowledge in chosen area of study
K2 Conduct an investigation into a problem in computing and/or technology and use appropriate analysis, design, implementation and evaluation techniques to investigate solutions to the problem, using existing sources of information as appropriate 
K3 Demonstrate an understanding of the professional, ethical, legal and social issues relevant to computing/technology developments
K4 Demonstrate the knowledge required for the degree apprenticeship standard
S1 Formulate and execute a plan of activities to achieve realistic objectives
S2 Critically review your own work
S4 Communicate project outcomes persuasively and professionally, as suited to your identified audience
S5 Take responsibility for your own learning, demonstrating self-direction, resilience, and maturity and originality in negotiating the project, planning and implementing tasks in a professional manner
S6 Demonstrate the skills and behaviour required for the degree apprenticeship standard
